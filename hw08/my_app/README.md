### Report your process

Most of the work in the shiny app were easier as there was proper documentation. 
1. I am a windows user and I faced difficulty in deploying the shiny app in a server as the available resources were not free version. I ended up deploying it in shinyapps.io as it is only free option available for windows users, to my knowledge.
3. It was a great homework as it helped me understand how shiny apps work and the different intricate details. Being a web-developer myself, I found that using shiny makes lot of things compact and easier to implement such as javascript(shinyjs), css etc. It is also responsive by design which I found an excellent in built feature.
