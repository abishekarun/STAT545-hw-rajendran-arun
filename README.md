## First Homework for Stat 545A Course 

### Introduction: 

I am *Arun Rajendran* , 1<sup>st</sup> year **Master of Science** graduate student in **Department of Mathematics**. I am really interested in data science and have taken this course to start my data science journey.

Here is a picture of me:

The steps I performed to make changes to **Readme.md** file  are:

1. Pull the repo from Github
    + Opened new project in RStudio 
    + Pasted the url of repo  
2. Made the changes locally using Rstudio as markdown editor
3. Saved the changes locally.
4. Committed the changes to the repo.
5. Performed the pull request and then pushed the commit to the Github.

I have also submitted the [R markdown document](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw01-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.Rmd) and the [Rendered Markdown 
File](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw01-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.md) for __gapminder data__.

I have already had experience with github using git bash. But, using Rstudio as a client was a new experience. It was a lot easier than using git commands but Rstudio offers less flexibility than git bash. 

I have usually used R scripts for exploring datasets. R Markdown file provides a useful to include code with text such that it is useful for others to understand the code. It also offers a very easy way to create tutorials. But as the prof suggested in class, it sometimes becomes redundant.

Most of the work in markdown and readme file was easier except the image embed part. For image embed, I faced difficulty since I had to resize the image. I ended up using img tag to embed the image. I also couldnt change the text color since this feature was not available in github flavor.
