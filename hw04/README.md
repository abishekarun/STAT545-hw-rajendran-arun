## Repo for Fourth Homework of Stat 545A Course 

This is the *readme file* for the fourth homework. 
Different reshaping functions such as **melt()**, **dcast()**, **gather()**, **spread()**, **expand** etc that belongs to **tidyr** package was explored in this assignment. Also functions for joining two data frames such as **left_join**,**right_join**,**full_join**,**semi_join**,**anti_join**,**inner_join** under **dplyr** package was extensively explored in this assignment. 
**Knitr** and **kable** package was used for making nice tables.

You can find the [R markdown document](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw04/hw04_gapminder.Rmd) and the [Rendered Markdown 
File](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw04/hw04_gapminder.md).

### Progress Part

Most of the work in markdown file was easier except the part where I had to include a piece of code common for all the files.I ended up using source for this purpose.This homework was a nice experience as it helped me understand the difference between different functions used for reshaping and their significance. It also helped me understand the different types of joins and how they are different from the earlier used functions such as **merge()** and **match()**. 

The resources that helped me are:
