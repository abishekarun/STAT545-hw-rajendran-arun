## Repo for Second Homework of Stat 545A Course 

This is the *readme file* for the second homework. 
**Gapminder** dataset was explored.Different functions such as **filter()**,**piping**,**select()**,**arrange()** etc that belongs to **dplyr** package was explored in this assignment. Also **ggplot** was extensively explored in this assignment. **Knitr** and **kable** package was used for making nice tables.

You can find the [R markdown document](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw02/hw02_gapminder.Rmd) and the [Rendered Markdown 
File](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw02/hw02_gapminder.md) for __gapminder data__.

### Progress Part

Most of the work in markdown file was easier except the part where I had two consecutive r scripts without any text between them.This was not rendering properly in github.I couldn't find out the reason and ended up adding text between them to get it properly. 

The resources that helped me are:

+ [ggplot cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) 
+ [dplyr package manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf)
