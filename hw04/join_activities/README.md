## Repo for Joining activites in 4th homework stat545 

This is the *readme file* for the joining activities in fourth homework. 
Functions for joining two data frames such as **left_join**, **right_join**, **full_join**,**semi_join**,**anti_join**,**inner_join** under **dplyr** package was extensively explored in this assignment. 
**Knitr** and **kable** package was used for making nice tables.

You can find the [activity 1 markdown file](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw04/join_activities/activity1.md) and the [activity 2 markdown file](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw04/join_activities/activity2.md)
