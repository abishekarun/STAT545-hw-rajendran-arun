## Hw 10 Data from Web

### Make API queries “by hand” using httr

_For the code to this part, check out [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw10/api_httr_prompts.R)._

For this part, I have taken Open Movie Database API discussed in class and made query for my favourite list of movies(15 of them) and tried finding the movie with best Imdb rating, metacritic score and rotten tomatoes score.

```{r message = FALSE}
source('api_httr_prompts.R')
```

The list of movies and their year
```{r}
list_of_movies
release_years
```

Plot of imdb rating of the movies 
![](plots/imdb.png)

Plot of metacritic rating of the movies 
![](plots/metacritic.png)

Plot of rotten tomatoes rating of the movies 
![](plots/rotten_tomatoes.png)

From these plots, following conclusions can be made
  - **The Shawshank redemption(1994)** has highest imdb rating among selected movies.
  - **The Godfather(1972)** has highest Rotten Tomatoes rating among selected movies.
  - **12 Angry Men(1957)** has highest Metacritic rating among selected movies.

### Scrape the web

_For the code to this part, check out [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw10/scrape_data_prompts.R)._

For this part, I have taken few favorite bands(3 namely "Eminem","Katy Perry","Maroon 5") and tried to get the lyrics for most of their songs from musix match website. This is an extension to the work that was done in the class. 

Here is the final table obtained after scraping the musix match site.
```{r}
options(width = 50)
musix_results <- readRDS('data/musix_match_results.rds')
musix_results%>%
  head(10)
```

From this table, we can find the band which has most number of songs in this website among the three.

```{r}
table(musix_results$Band)
```

The same can be seen in a plot as shown below.
![](plots/musix_result.png)

From this plot, it can be seen that **Eminem** had the most number of songs in the three bands chosen.

### Use an R package that wraps an API

_For the code to this part, check out [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw10/wrap_api_prompts.R)._

### Prompt 1

#### Part 1

What is the relationship between per-capita GDP and the proportion of the population which lives in urban centers?

The relationship can be seen from the graph below.
![](plots/prompt1part1.png)

From the graph, it can be seen that though the relationship is **not uniform** across all the countries, generally, as population in urban centers **increases** gdpPercap increases as observed from the above plot.

#### Part 2

Plot a graph of population density against time for diffrent continents.

The graph can be seen as below.
![](plots/prompt1part2.png)

From the graph, it can be concluded that Population density **increases** for all the continents but it increases at a **greater rate** for countries in **Asia** which might be due to the large increase in population.

### Prompt 2

rplos and rebird – how many articles are published on a bird species?

Here is the dataset showing the number of articles which contains the top 50 popular bird species in their title (highlighted title and abstract are shown)

```{r}
articles_bird <- readRDS('data/prompt2_wrap_api.rds')

articles_bird%>%
  head(20)%>%
  kable()
```

The plot of the number of articles on different birds can be seen below.
![](plots/articles_bird.png)

This plot clearly shows that the bird species **Mallard** has the most number of titular articles published on it.
