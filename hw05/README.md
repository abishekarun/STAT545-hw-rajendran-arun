## Repo for Fifth Homework of Stat 545A Course 

This is the *readme file* for the fifth homework. 
**Gapminder** dataset was explored.Different functions such as **fct_relevel()**,**fct_reorder()** etc that belongs to **forcats** package was explored in this assignment. Functions such as **write_csv()**, **read_csv()**,
**dput()** and **dget()** was explored for reading and writing tables. Also **ggplot** was extensively explored in this assignment with different theme options applied. Package **RColorBrewer** was used for palettes.**Knitr**,**kable** and **pander** package was used for making nice tables.

You can find the [R markdown document](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw03/hw05_gapminder.Rmd),the [markdown document](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw03/hw05_gapminder.md) for __gapminder data__.

Most of the work in markdown file was easier with the forcats functions and ggplot theme styles.Difficulties that I experienced were
1. Embedding ggplot after saving as a file inside the markdown. This was very difficult and I found many links and ended up putting it as a link.
2. It was difficult to use theme styles to make ggplot look nicer as I had not done this earlier. But it was a good experience and now I am confident about styling plots henceforth.
3. It was a great homework as it helped me understand the factor management and the importance of the same. I also understood the difference between different funcitons for writing and reading files.
