## Repo for First Homework of Stat 545A Course 

This is the readme file for the first homework. Gapminder dataset was explored. 
Different functions such as nrow(),summary(),table(),levels() etc were explored in this assignment. Also plots such as basic plots,histograms,bar plots etc. were made.

You can find the [R markdown document](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw01/hw01_gapminder.Rmd) and the [Rendered Markdown 
File](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw01/hw01_gapminder.md) for __gapminder data__.

### Progress Part

I have already had experience with github using git bash. But, using Rstudio as a client was a new experience. It was a lot easier than using git commands but Rstudio offers less flexibility than git bash. 

I have usually used R scripts for exploring datasets. R Markdown file provides a useful to include code with text such that it is useful for others to understand the code. It also offers a very easy way to create tutorials. But as the prof suggested in class, it sometimes becomes redundant.

Most of the work in markdown and readme file was easier except the image embed part. For image embed, I faced difficulty since I had to resize the image. I ended up using img tag to embed the image. I also couldnt change the text color since this feature was not available in github flavor.
