## Repo for Second Homework of Stat 545A Course 

This is the readme file for the second homework. Gapminder dataset was explored. 
Different functions such as filter(),piping,select(),arrange() etc that belongs to 
dplyr package was explored in this assignment. Also ggplot was extensively explored in this assignment. Knitr and kable package was used for making nice tables.

You can find the [R markdown document](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw02/hw02_gapminder.Rmd) and the [Rendered Markdown 
File](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw02/hw02_gapminder.md) for __gapminder data__.
