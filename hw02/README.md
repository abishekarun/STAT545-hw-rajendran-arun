## Repo for Second Homework of Stat 545A Course 

This is the *readme file* for the second homework. 
**Gapminder** dataset was explored.Different functions such as **filter()**,**piping**,**select()**,**arrange()** etc that belongs to **dplyr** package was explored in this assignment. Also **ggplot** was extensively explored in this assignment. **Knitr** and **kable** package was used for making nice tables.

You can find the [R markdown document](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw02/hw02_gapminder.Rmd) and the [Rendered Markdown 
File](https://github.com/abishekarun/STAT545-hw-rajendran-arun/blob/master/hw02/hw02_gapminder.md) for __gapminder data__.
