### Process and reflection

- I found this homework a bit challenging, but now I have got better understanding of the functioning of packages. 
- This homework was essential as it helpmed the flow pipeline of creating a package and the minute details involved. 
- I also understood the imporatnce of creating proper documentation and the different types in documentation.
- I found working with testhat little bit challenging especially for the failure case. But once I understood that, it was very helpful to identify the validity of different functions.
- I also found it difficult to push it to the git repo as it was different from the previous times. But I managed to do it after 2-3 attempts.
